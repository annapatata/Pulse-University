# Pulse University Music Festival Database
## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database for Pulse University, an international music festival that takes place once a year during the summer and lasts 3-5 days. Each festival hosts multiple events on each day, which in turn consist of 3 performances (warm up/opening act, main act, closing act). The system manages information about the events, the performances, the artists and bands that are available to perform, the performers which are the artists/bands that have performed or are scheduled to perform, the staff and equipment required for each performance. Also, besides the management of visitors and tickets to an event, the database supports a resale FIFO queue where unactivated tickets can be resold and potential buyers can request specific tickets or ticket for a specific performance and ticket class. Lastly, the reviews of activated tickets concerning a specific performance are stored and analyzed in some of the queries.
